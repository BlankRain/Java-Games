<h1> Overview </h1> 
The targets in most of your missions would be <font color = "ff0000">enemy</font> aircraft and ground batteries, which are marked by their red highlights in contrast to <font color = "00ffff">fiendly</font> units' light blue highlights.

<h2> Weapons </h1>
<div class="box">
<h3> Machine Guns </h3>
The machine gun is the primary weapon of most aircraft. It has moderate range and fires a spray of projectiles that makes it easier to hit moving targets.
</div>
<div class="box">
<h3> Bombs </h3>
Bombs are simply released from the aircraft without any speed, and freefall in gravity until they collide with something.<br>
<br>
Bombs damage everything in a 75m radius around the point of impact. This means that it is not necessary to score a direct hit on the target, though they could also damage the aircraft which launched them if it is too close.
</div>
<div class="box">
<h3> Missiles </h3>
Missiles are slow moving projectiles that home onto the selected target.<br>
<br>
Missiles take a moment before they activate and begin seeking their target, making them useless at short range. They also have a large turning radius and may miss targets that are manoeuvring aggressively.

<h3> Ground Battery </h3>

</div>
Stationary emplacements, ground batteries have a large amount of firepower and hitpoints. On the other hand, the fact that they are stationary means they are easily avoided and easy targets.
<br><br>
Ground Batteries have a maximum and minimum elevation for firing, making it possible to avoid their fire entirely by approaching at the correct angle.

<h3> Aircraft </h3>

</div>
Modeled on the flight characteristics of an F16, aircraft are lightly armed, fragile, fast and manoeuvrable. Although they pack less firepower and hitpoints than ground batteries, their ability to manoeuvre makes them difficult to hit and allows them to bring their guns to bear onto enemies much more easily.
<br><br>
Aircraft tend to be armed with machine guns and one secondary weapon, either bombs or missiles.
